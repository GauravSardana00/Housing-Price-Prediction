# Housing-Price-Prediction
This is the capstone project that I have done in Almabetter Data Science curriculum.All the models developed in this project will be heavily based on regression as continuous dependent variable needs to be predicted.In this case model is predicting the price with respect to other variables.

# Introduction
Predicting housing prices is a critical endeavor in real estate and urban planning, facilitating informed decision-making for buyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers alike. By leveraging advanced predictive modeling techniques, housing price prediction aims to forecast property values based on a myriad of factors such as location, property size, amenities, economic indicators, and market trends.

Accurate housing price prediction not only aids prospective buyers in making sound investment choices but also assists sellers in setting competitive prices and optimizing their returns. Additionally, it enables policymakers and urban planners to gauge housing affordability, identify areas of gentrification or decline, and formulate effective housing policies to address societal needs.

In an era characterized by dynamic real estate markets and evolving consumer preferences, robust housing price prediction models serve as invaluable tools for navigating the complexities of the housing market, driving economic growth, and fostering sustainable urban development.

# Objective
The Housing Price Prediction initiative seeks to analyze and forecast property values, aiming to grasp trends and identify influential features shaping housing prices in the region.

# Models
In this project I am implementing 2 machine learning algorithms to predict the target variable and also I have applied optimization techniques to get the best resulting R-Square and MSE.

Following models have been used for predictions:-

Linear Regression and Random Forest , along with Hyperparameter tuning and Cross-Validation techniques.
